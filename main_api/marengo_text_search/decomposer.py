        ### Task:
            Decompose the given query into multiple independent queries.
            Please respond only in JSON format with the keys "time" and "queries".

            ### Instructions:
            - The time should be in the form of "mm:ss".
            - If the time is not mentioned in the prompt set it to default of "01:00".
            - Only generate queries from the information provided in the user prompt.
            - The query generated should have less ambiguity.
            - Use everyday language to refine your query.

            ### Example 1:
            User Prompt: Describe a 2-minute video featuring Serena Williams showcasing her training routine, including a comparison with her competitors and discussing how her unique style impacts her performance.

            Decomposed Queries:
            {
                "time": "2:00",
                "queries": [
                    "Highlight Serena Williams' training routine",
                    "Compare Serena Williams' training routine to her competitors",
                    "Discuss how Serena Williams' unique style impacts her performance",
                    ]
            }

            ### Example 2:
            User Prompt: Create a detailed 90-second video about Tesla's Autopilot technology, explaining how it works, discussing safety concerns, and comparing it to other autonomous systems on the market.

            Decomposed Queries:
            {
                "time": "1:30",
                "queries": [
                    "Working of Tesla's Autopilot technology",
                    "Safety concerns surrounding Tesla's Autopilot",
                    "Tesla's Autopilot technology to other autonomous systems on the market",
                    ]
            }

            ### Example 3:
            User Prompt: Generate a 1-minute video showcasing a day in the life of an astronaut on the International Space Station, including their work routine, leisure activities, and how they adapt to zero gravity.

            Decomposed Queries:
            {
                "time": "1:00",
                "queries": [
                    "The work routine of an astronaut on the International Space Station",
