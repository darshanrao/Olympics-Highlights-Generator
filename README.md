## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

Our project integrates multiple AI models and APIs in a unified workflow:  
1. **Video Search**: User prompts guide the Marengo model (TwelveLabs) to extract relevant Olympic clips from a curated database.  
2. **Script Generation**: The Pegasus model generates commentary tailored to the video context.  
3. **Text-to-Speech**: ElevenLabs' API creates lifelike voice-overs from the script.  
4. **Video Editing**: A custom algorithm aligns visuals with narration, ensuring perfect synchronization.  
5. **Web Interface**: A user-friendly platform allows seamless interaction with the system.
